# Introduction

This guide introduces the "Norwegian Singles" training approach, adapted from the high-volume Norwegian model often associated with double threshold sessions. This "singles" variant emphasizes frequent, *single* sub-threshold workouts per day, suitable for runners seeking sustainable improvement in aerobic capacity and performance over the long term, particularly those training 5-9 hours per week. The core idea is maximizing repeatable training load while managing fatigue.
