# Training Load (CTL/TSS)

*   **Concept:** Training Stress Score (TSS) or similar metrics attempt to quantify the stress of a single workout based on duration and intensity relative to your threshold. Chronic Training Load (CTL) is a rolling average (often 42 days, exponentially weighted) of daily TSS, representing your fitness or sustainable load.
*   **Application:** This method allows for accumulating a high CTL due to the repeatability of sub-threshold work. Many users find a correlation between increasing CTL and improved performance, though it's not a perfect predictor and the absolute value isn't comparable between individuals. Tracking your own CTL trend is key.
*   **Tracking:** Tools like Intervals.icu, TrainingPeaks, or Runalyze calculate TSS/CTL. Consistent data input (accurate threshold values, chosen metric) is key. Pace-based TSS (rTSS) is often preferred for consistency if running routes/conditions are stable, but requires accurate threshold pace updates.
