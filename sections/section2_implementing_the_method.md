# Implementing the Method

## Weekly Structure
The standard recommendation is 3 quality (sub-threshold) sessions per week, interspersed with 3-4 easy runs, following a pattern like E-Q-E-Q-E-Q-LR(Easy).

*   E: Easy workout
*   Q: Quality workout (sub-threshold intervals)
*   LR: Long Run (Easy pace)
*   R: Rest day

One easy run might be longer (75-90 mins often sufficient for up to HM). A rest day can replace an easy day if needed (E-Q-E-Q-R-Q-LR), but the 7-day structure maximizes consistent load. Combining quality work into the long run is generally discouraged as it disrupts the load/recovery balance (though marathon adaptations exist). For higher volumes (e.g., 9+ hours/week), adding easy doubles on easy days is often preferred over extending single runs or adding volume around Q sessions initially.

**Example Weekly Structures:**

*   **Beginner/Lower Volume:**
    *   Mon: Easy
    *   Tue: SubT (e.g., 1 x 3000m)
    *   Wed: Easy
    *   Thu: SubT (e.g., 2 x 2000m, 90s rest)
    *   Fri: Easy
    *   Sat: SubT (e.g., 4 x 1000m, 60s rest)
    *   Sun: Rest or Easy/Long Run

*   **Advanced/Higher Volume:**
    *   Mon: Easy
    *   Tue: SubT (e.g., 3 x 3000m, 120s rest)
    *   Wed: Easy (+/- double easy)
    *   Thu: SubT (e.g., 4 x 2000m, 90s rest)
    *   Fri: Easy (+/- double easy)
    *   Sat: SubT (e.g., 8-10 x 1000m, 60s rest)
    *   Sun: Long Run (Easy)

## Quality Workouts (Sub-Threshold)

*   **Format:** Intervals with relatively short rest. Rest can be standing, walking, or slow jogging. The key is maintaining the sub-threshold effort *during* the work interval.
*   **Volume:** Aim for total sub-threshold work to be 20-25% of your total weekly running *time*. Start conservatively (e.g., 20-25 mins total work per session) and build gradually. For lower weekly volumes (e.g., <5 hours), maintaining 3 sessions might mean shorter workout durations.
*   **Time vs. Distance:** Using time-based intervals (e.g., 10 x 3 min) instead of distance (e.g., 10 x 1k) ensures consistent workout duration regardless of pace, which can be beneficial for consistency and comparing load across different ability levels. However, distance-based intervals are also common.
*   **Pacing:** Remember LT2 is an *effort level* over time, not a fixed speed. Shorter intervals can be run slightly faster than longer intervals while maintaining the same sub-threshold physiological state. Use current fitness and monitoring tools (lactate, HR, RPE) to guide pace.
*   **Example Distance-Based Workouts (Paces are approximate guides, adjust based on individual LT2):**

    | Distance | Pace Guide        | Rest    |
    | :------- | :---------------- | :------ |
    | 3000m    | ~25k-30k pace     | 120s    |
    | 2000m    | ~21.1k-25k pace   | 90s     |
    | 1600m    | ~10 mile pace     | 60s-90s |
    | 1000m    | ~10k to <15k pace | 60s     |

*   **Example Time-Based Workouts (adjust reps/duration based on total weekly time target):**
    *   `10-12 x 3 min` (Rest: 60s) @ ~15k pace effort
    *   `25 x 1 min` (Rest: 30s) @ ~10k/CV pace effort
    *   `6-8 x 5-6 min` (Rest: 60s) @ ~10 mile pace effort
    *   `5-6 x 6-8 min` (Rest: 60s) @ ~Half Marathon pace effort
    *   `3-4 x 10-12 min` (Rest: 60-120s) @ ~Half Marathon to 30k pace effort
    *   `3-4 x 15 min` (Rest: 90-120s) @ ~30k pace effort (often used in marathon builds)
*   **Variety:** While consistency is key, rotating through different interval formats (e.g., 10x1k Tue, 5x2k Thu, 3x3k Sat) can provide slightly different stimuli and prevent monotony. The physiological benefit difference between formats at the same sub-threshold state is debated, but variety is often beneficial psychologically.

## Getting Started & Progression
*   **Beginners:** If new to structured intensity, start with **2 quality sessions** per week instead of 3. Focus first on building consistent weekly volume you can sustain, then gradually increase the duration/reps of the quality sessions or add the third session.
*   Increase the *duration* or *number* of sub-threshold reps slowly.
*   Increase overall weekly running time (mostly via easy runs) proportionally to maintain the ~75/25 easy/quality split.
*   Regularly update target paces/HR zones based on recent (within 4-8 weeks) races or time trials.
*   Monitor Training Load (see below) and listen to your body.
