# Implementing the Method

## Weekly Structure
The standard recommendation is 3 quality (sub-threshold) sessions per week, interspersed with 3-4 easy runs, following a pattern like E-Q-E-Q-E-Q-LR(Easy).
*   E: Easy workout
*   Q: Quality workout (sub-threshold intervals)
*   LR: Long Run (Easy pace)
*   R: Rest day
    
    One easy run might be longer (75-90 mins often sufficient for up to HM). A rest day can replace an easy day if needed (E-Q-E-Q-R-Q-LR), but the 7-day structure maximizes consistent load. Combining quality work into the long run is generally discouraged as it disrupts the load/recovery balance (though marathon adaptations exist). For higher volumes (e.g., 9+ hours/week), adding easy doubles on easy days is often preferred over extending single runs or adding volume around Q sessions initially.

## Quality Workouts (Sub-Threshold)

*   **Format:** Intervals with short rest (typically 60 seconds; maybe 90-120s for very long reps like 3k+, or 30-45s for very short reps <1min). Rest can be standing, walking, or slow jogging.
*   **Volume:** Aim for total sub-threshold work to be 20-25% of your total weekly running *time*. Start conservatively (e.g., 20-25 mins total work per session) and build gradually. For lower weekly volumes (e.g., <5 hours), maintaining 3 sessions might mean shorter workout durations.
*   **Time vs. Distance:** Using time-based intervals (e.g., 10 x 3 min) instead of distance (e.g., 10 x 1k) ensures consistent workout duration regardless of pace, which can be beneficial for consistency and comparing load across different ability levels.
*   **Examples (adjust reps/duration based on total weekly time target):**
    *   `10-12 x 3 min` (Rest: 60s) @ ~15k pace effort
    *   `25 x 1 min` (Rest: 30s) @ ~10k/CV pace effort
    *   `6-8 x 5-6 min` (Rest: 60s) @ ~10 mile pace effort
    *   `5-6 x 6-8 min` (Rest: 60s) @ ~Half Marathon pace effort
    *   `3-4 x 10-12 min` (Rest: 60-120s) @ ~Half Marathon to 30k pace effort
    *   `3-4 x 15 min` (Rest: 90-120s) @ ~30k pace effort (often used in marathon builds)
*   **Variety:** While consistency is key, rotating through different interval formats (e.g., 10x3min Tue, 5x6min Thu, 3x10min Sat) can provide slightly different stimuli and prevent monotony. The physiological benefit difference between formats at the same sub-threshold state is debated, but variety may help.

## Progression
*   Increase the *duration* or *number* of sub-threshold reps slowly.
*   Increase overall weekly running time (mostly via easy runs) proportionally to maintain the ~75/25 easy/quality split.
*   Regularly update target paces/HR zones based on recent (within 4-8 weeks) races or time trials.
*   Monitor Training Load (see below) and listen to your body.
