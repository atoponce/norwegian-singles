# Benefits and Monitoring

## Pros
High sustainable training load, significant aerobic development, potential for consistent PBs across various distances (especially 5k-HM), reduced injury risk compared to high-intensity plans (if intensity is controlled), effective for time-crunched runners (5-9 hours/week often cited), repeatable and relatively simple structure. Notably effective for masters athletes seeking continued improvement.

## Cons
Requires discipline to control intensity, can be monotonous for some, less focus on top-end speed/VO2max (may need occasional strides/races), adaptation takes time and may involve plateaus.

## Monitoring
Use regular (4-8 weeks) races or time trials (e.g., 5k) to gauge fitness and update training zones/paces. Track CTL to monitor load progression relative to your history. Listen to your body for signs of excessive fatigue or needing to adjust intensity down (RPE, motivation, recovery between sessions, sleep quality).
