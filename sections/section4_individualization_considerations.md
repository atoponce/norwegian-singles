# Individualization & Considerations

## Pace Setting & Tools
Use *current* fitness. Erring slightly slower is safer than going too fast, especially initially. Some find commonly suggested paces too fast and need to adjust significantly downwards based on lactate or HR, particularly if more fast-twitch dominant or less aerobically developed.

*   **Pace as a Guide:** Remember that paces are guides; the *internal effort/load* (monitored via lactate, HR, power, RPE) is the primary target. The relationship between pace and effort can vary daily due to factors like fatigue, weather, etc.
*   **Calculators & Estimators:** Tools like [VDOT calculators](https://lactrace.com/norwegian-singles), [lactate threshold analyzers](https://lactate.barts.space/), race result predictors, or specific calculators (like the Excel sheet or HR calculator mentioned in the source document) can provide useful starting points for estimating appropriate sub-threshold paces or HR zones based on recent performance data. However, these are still estimates and should be validated with internal monitoring methods.

## Heat/Humidity
Environmental conditions drastically affect performance. Significantly slow down paces in heat/humidity to maintain the correct sub-threshold effort. HR becomes less reliable as a guide in these conditions due to cardiac drift caused by heat stress. Focus on RPE and adjust pace downwards as needed.

## Racing/Time Trials
Frequent racing (e.g., parkruns) or time trials (e.g., 3k-5k every 4-8 weeks) are highly recommended. They provide neuromuscular stimulus, help break plateaus, allow practice at race effort ("remembering how to hurt"), and provide benchmarks to update training paces. Initial races after a long block of only sub-T work might feel flat or sluggish ("racing rust") before the body readjusts to higher intensities.

## Adaptation Time, Stagnation & Consistency
Expect 4-8 weeks (or longer, especially for FT types or those new to structured training) to adapt. Significant breakthroughs often occur after longer periods of consistent application (3-6+ months). Periods of apparent stagnation are common and often precede performance jumps. Consistency through these phases is crucial.

## Muscle Fiber Type
The method appears very effective for slow-twitch (ST) dominant runners. More fast-twitch (FT) runners might still benefit significantly but may need careful load management, potentially slower paces initially, a longer adaptation period, or consider replacing one Q session with hills/strides if plateaus occur, though the core method is often sufficient even for FT types.

## Long Run
75-90 mins easy is often adequate for 5k-HM focus. Its role is primarily recovery and contributing to overall volume, rather than being a key high-stress workout itself. Marathon training requires longer runs (see below).

## Speed Work/Strides/Strength
The core method often excludes specific speed work or strength training. Neuromuscular stimulus comes from sub-T paces and occasional races/TTs. Strides (e.g., 6-8 x 15-30s) can be added 1-2 times per week after easy runs if desired, typically without compromising recovery. Some FT athletes might benefit more from strides or occasional short hill sprints (e.g., 6-10 x 8-10s). Strength training is debated; some find it beneficial for injury prevention or power, while others find it adds too much fatigue and compromises the 3x weekly quality sessions. Sirpoc's success without strength/strides is notable. If included, keep it light and ensure it doesn't impede recovery for running workouts.

## Fueling
Adequate carbohydrate intake is important to support the 3x weekly quality sessions and prevent glycogen depletion. Fuel well before and particularly in the hours after sub-T sessions. Increased training load may require increased overall caloric intake.

## Cross-Training
Can be used to supplement volume or substitute sessions during injury recovery, mimicking the E-Q-E-Q-E-Q-LR structure using modalities like cycling, elliptical, or arc trainer, focusing on similar durations and sub-threshold efforts.
