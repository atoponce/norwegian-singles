# Training Load (CTL/TSS)

## Concept
Training Stress Score (TSS) or similar metrics attempt to quantify the stress of a single workout based on duration and intensity relative to your threshold. Chronic Training Load (CTL) is a rolling average (often 42 days, exponentially weighted) of daily TSS, representing your fitness or sustainable load.

## Application & Correlation with Performance
This method allows for accumulating a high Chronic Training Load (CTL) due to the repeatability of sub-threshold work. Research and anecdotal evidence strongly suggest a correlation between the highest *sustained* CTL an athlete can manage and their race performance potential (as illustrated conceptually in the provided document's graph showing Critical Power vs. Sustained CTL). While not a perfect predictor, and absolute CTL values aren't directly comparable between individuals, tracking your *own* CTL trend is a key indicator of fitness progression. The goal is to maximize sustainable load over time.

## Intensity Management & Equivalent Stress
*   **Balancing Load:** The aim is to find the "green zone" (as conceptualized in the provided document) â€“ a level of weekly sub-threshold work that maximizes stimulus without inducing excessive fatigue or hindering recovery for subsequent sessions. This allows for consistent high-quality training week after week.
*   **Equivalent Stress:** Different sub-threshold workout structures (e.g., varying interval length, rest, and pace slightly) can be designed to elicit a similar overall training stress or stimulus (as explored in the document's ANNEX A). This allows for variety in training while maintaining a consistent load on the body. For example, a session of 10x1000m with shorter rest might be physiologically similar in stress to 3x3000m with longer rest, provided both are executed at the appropriate sub-threshold intensity for that duration.

## Tracking Tools
Tools like Intervals.icu, TrainingPeaks, or Runalyze calculate TSS/CTL. Consistent data input (accurate threshold values, chosen metric) is key. Pace-based TSS (rTSS) is often preferred for consistency if running routes/conditions are stable, but requires accurate threshold pace updates. Heart rate-based TSS (hrTSS) or power-based TSS can also be used, depending on your primary intensity monitoring method.
