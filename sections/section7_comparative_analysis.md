# Norwegian Singles vs. Other Training Methodologies

This section presents a concise comparison between Norwegian Singles and other established training approaches.

*   **Norwegian Singles vs. Daniels' Running Formula:** Norwegian Singles concentrates on consistent sub-threshold work (3x weekly) with minimal intensity variation, while Daniels prescribes multiple intensity zones (Easy, Marathon, Threshold, Interval, Repetition) with scheduled workouts that often exceed LT2. Daniels uses distinct training phases with changing workout types, whereas Norwegian Singles maintains the same workout structure year-round with gradual progression.
*   **Norwegian Singles vs. Lydiard Method:** Norwegian Singles employs a consistent year-round approach with sub-threshold as the primary quality intensity, while Lydiard uses sequential training phases (aerobic base → hills → speed → race-specific). Norwegian Singles maintains moderate long runs (75-90 mins for 5k-HM) at easy pace, whereas Lydiard emphasizes very long aerobic runs during base phase followed by increasing anaerobic work in later phases.
*   **Norwegian Singles vs. Pfitzinger Method:** Norwegian Singles distributes quality evenly through the week (E-Q-E-Q-E-Q-LR) focusing primarily on sub-threshold work, while Pfitzinger incorporates medium-long midweek runs and uses more varied intensities (including VO2max and specific race-pace work). Pfitzinger's plans are explicitly designed with marathon-specific elements and feature more complex mesocycle periodization rather than Norwegian Singles' consistent weekly pattern.
*   **Norwegian Singles vs. 80/20 Running:** Norwegian Singles dedicates ~20-25% of training to sub-threshold work (just below LT2), while 80/20 distributes 20% of training across a wider range of moderate-to-high intensities with significant work above LT2. The key difference is that Norwegian Singles concentrates quality in a narrow intensity band (high Zone 3/low Zone 4) rather than employing the polarized approach of 80/20 which emphasizes separation between easy (Zone 1-2) and hard (Zone 4-5) work.
*   **Key Differentiating Factors of Norwegian Singles:** What makes Norwegian Singles distinctive is its high frequency of quality sessions (3x weekly) at carefully controlled sub-threshold intensity, enabling consistency over long periods with minimal burnout risk. It emphasizes precise intensity control to maximize repeatability and sustainable progression, with less supplementary work (strides, hills, strength) than other systems. This approach is particularly suited for time-limited runners, slower recoverers, and those seeking long-term sustainable development.
