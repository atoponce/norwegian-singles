# Applicability to Different Distances

This method, focusing on sub-threshold work, is primarily designed for the **general preparation phase** of training, building a strong aerobic base. Its direct applicability varies slightly by race distance:

## 5k to Half Marathon
This is the sweet spot where the method seems most directly applicable and has shown significant success for many hobby joggers. Regular racing/TTs provide sufficient speed stimulus.

## 1500m/Mile
The strong aerobic base built is highly beneficial. May be sufficient on its own, with races providing speed stimulus. Some suggest adding strides, weekly hill sprints (e.g., 10x30s), or replacing a Q session with faster reps (e.g., 300s/400s at race pace) periodically or in a pre-competition phase.

## 800m
Likely requires more specific speed, power, and anaerobic capacity work than this method provides. While the aerobic base is helpful, dedicated 800m training approaches are probably more suitable.

## Marathon
Applying the core 3x weekly sub-T structure requires adaptation for the marathon. Common strategies include:

*   **Extending the Long Run:** Gradually increasing the duration, often towards 2-3 hours, primarily at an easy effort.
*   **Incorporating Quality into the LR:** Some runners integrate sub-threshold or marathon pace (MP) work towards the end of the long run, such as `3 x 10 minutes @ HMP` with short rests, or a continuous `30-minute block @ MP`. This is often done instead of a mid-week quality session.
*   **Longer Sub-Threshold Reps:** Replacing standard sessions with longer intervals like `3x5k`, `4x5k`, or even `5x5k` at sub-threshold effort, particularly in the later stages of the marathon block.
*   **Marathon Pace Workouts:** Introducing specific MP workouts, sometimes as tempos (e.g., `10k @ MP`) within a medium-long run, especially closer to the race.
*   **Fueling/Hydration Practice:** These longer sessions are crucial for practicing race-day nutrition and hydration strategies.
Consistency and high volume remain vital, but marathon-specific long runs and targeted MP work are generally considered necessary additions or modifications to the base 'singles' structure.

## Ultramarathons
Even more experimental. Requires very high volume and race-specific long runs (back-to-backs, runs with significant elevation). Some might experiment with double-threshold days (e.g., AM track session, PM uphill treadmill session) but this significantly increases load and risk. Logistics like fueling, hydration, and gear become critical.

## Cadence/Form
Running form, including cadence, is highly individual. While some proponents of this method exhibit very high cadence (e.g., >200 spm during races), it's generally considered an outcome of training and individual biomechanics rather than a specific target to manipulate. Focusing on consistent, controlled effort is more important than consciously altering form aspects like cadence, which may not be necessary or beneficial for all runners.

## Note on Peaking
While this method forms a strong base, specific race preparation ("peaking") might involve introducing higher intensity workouts (e.g., VO2max intervals, race pace work) closer to a key event, depending on the distance and individual needs. This is typically considered a separate phase built upon the foundation laid by consistent sub-threshold training.
